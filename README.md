# Shitscord-v2
A newer, better version of the classic shitscord bot
This is a Discord bot built using discord.py and PRAW. It will retrieve images and text from Reddit, depending on what parameters are passed. Shitscord was designed for easy transfer between a development environment (Either Linux or Windows) and the production environment (Heroku). Once this bot has more features, a link will be added, should you want to use this bot. Hosting yourself should also be fairly simple, you just wont automatically recieve the newest versions.
